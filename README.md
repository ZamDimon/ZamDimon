## :person_curly_hair: About me: 
ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
I am Dmytro Zakharov. 

Currently, I am the Ukraine Global Scholars 501(c)(3) finalist and Karazin National University student. 
My main interests are Programming, Game Development, and Physics. ðŸ‘€

During my school years, 
I have participated in numerous Olympiads and tournaments in Physics on national and international levels.
However, I am not a pure physicist. 
Before my Olympiad career I enjoyed creating games and programming in general. 
My first game project, although insanely simple, I did when I was a 4th-grade student. 
Since then, I have further developed my programming skills in parallel with studying Physics, trying different fields, tools, and languages.
